# processing.net-with-android-studio
This is an example for running the library processing.net with a processing sketch on android studio.
The .pde file is the processing sketch to run on a PC, the .zip file is the AS project to run on a smartphone.
For this example to work, you will have to set your ip adress in the android studio sketch (class sketch).
